# MNIST Model
Two python notebooks that demonstrate step-by-step how to create a neural network without TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.

If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented programming (OOP), then I'd recommend starting with the `mnist_model.ipynb` notebook. This notebook is a bit more beginner-friendly, and it is a bit easier to follow along with.

If you are familiar with OOP, then starting with the `mnist_model_oop.ipynb` notebook might be a better option. It is more modular, and it is easier to add new features to the neural network.

If you are struggling with the calculus and linear algebra behind neural networks, I hope this notebook is helpful, because that is why I built it. There are many included images to reinforce these concepts, but it does require a surface-level understanding of machine learning, calculus, and linear algebra.

This would be a great notebook for:
- Beginners to neural networks
- People who are curious about the math that neural networks are built on
- Anyone looking to reinforce some concepts that might have not stuck with them
