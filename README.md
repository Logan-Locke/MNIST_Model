# MNIST Model
A beginner-friendly notebook that demonstrates step-by-step how to create a neural network without TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.

If you are struggling with the calculus and linear algebra behind neural networks, I hope this notebook is helpful, because that is why I built it. There are many included images to reinforce these concepts, but it does require a surface-level understanding of machine learning, calculus, and linear algebra.

This would be a great notebook for:
- Beginners to neural networks
- People who are curious about the math that neural networks are built on
- Anyone looking to reinforce some concepts that might have not stuck with them
